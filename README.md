## Port Scanner
A simple and good (only saying to satisfy myself) port scanner. You might going to face some bugs, but it is still worth checking :smile:

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/dipanshparmar/port_scanner.git`

that's it :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

## Syntax
`./scanner.py <ip or hostname> <starting port> <ending port>`
